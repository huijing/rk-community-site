Hello RK friends,

We are closing this meetup group within a month. In the future, please use our website (https://reactknowledgeable.org/) as home base for any updates and RSVP for events. And the best way to reach out to us is via twitter @reknowledgeable.

Our RSVP requires that you have a GitHub account, which, as we speak today, is the most common platform that us developers share. We record only the necessary information to run our events. All our code is open sourced (https://github.com/react-knowledgeable/rk-community-site/) and you may review that we're not doing funny things with your information. In the mean time, you are more than welcome to contribute :)

While we are grateful that many members learned about us via meetup.com, we are moving away because we are wary of meetup.com's payment policy. RK is a community run by volunteer work, it is our responsibility to keep our cost in check. Our main goal is to consistently run this fun & friendly podium to share what we learn as a React developer, we believe we can bring people together without being reliant on specific platform. So, we hope you will still be with us outside of meetup.com, because we are still expecting great talks from all of you.
